This is my test repository (sorry for the typo in the name). 

Here I can test and practise. 

## Test 1: Permanent remove file

For my first test, I needed Carls help. I wanted to remove some files, and it did not work initially. He managed to remove the target files ("Musterloesung"). I tried later with another test file ("File3.R"), and it worked, too. No idea what I did differently.
